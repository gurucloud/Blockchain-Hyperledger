/**
 * <p>Deletes a secret and all of its versions. You can specify a recovery
 *       window during which you can restore the secret. The minimum recovery window is 7 days.
 *       The default recovery window is 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a <code>DeletionDate</code> stamp to
 *       the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window,
 *       Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently.</p>
 *          <p>For information about deleting a secret in the console, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_delete-secret.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_delete-secret.html</a>. </p>
 *          <p>Secrets Manager performs the permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period as a
 *         background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the
 *         recovery window for the permanent delete to occur.</p>
 *          <p>At any time before recovery window ends, you can use <a>RestoreSecret</a> to
 *       remove the <code>DeletionDate</code> and cancel the deletion of the secret.</p>
 *          <p>In a secret scheduled for deletion, you cannot access the encrypted secret value.
 *       To access that information, first cancel the deletion with <a>RestoreSecret</a> and then retrieve the information.</p>
 *          <p>
 *             <b>Required permissions: </b>
 *             <code>secretsmanager:DeleteSecret</code>.
